    <h1>Social Media Monitoring</h1>
    <p>The idea of government monitoring increasing by the public is not widely accepted. A common idea of government monitoring and surveillance is that it should only be allowed when searching for a threat or using more invasive forms of information gathering when permitted by a judge because of the seriousness or threat an issue imposes. The idea of increased government monitoring while not inherently bad when used to create a safer environment also creates a target on this new well of information by bad actors and creates a larger chance of misuse due to it eventually becoming more accessible. Other students in this class have also expressed the idea of the government overstepping its current monitoring power. The government's use of information could be overbearing due to the amount of data they would have the ability to collect far surpassing the amount needed at this point with permission from government entities. meaning they would be collecting more data on people than needed for investigations or just normal monitoring of the public</p>
    
    <header><b>Pros of Social Media Monitoring</b></header>
    <p>
      Different parts of the government already monitor social media due to the amount of information that goes through it. The monitoring of social media gives the government a general idea of what is going on due to how its uses now far surpass its use to keep in contact with friends. Social media is used to spread news and awareness on many different social groups and ideas and can be used to create events like protests to increase support and attendance of such events. The government's monitoring of such situations can act as a warning for them to prepare for similar events. An example of this could be mobilizing the police to protect protesters from potential altercations with people who have differing opinions. The use of this information is important so that they can be there to protect protesters and prevent bad actors from attending these events with no other thought than to cause chaos.

<header><b>Cons and misuse of Soical Media Monitoring</b></header>
    <p>While most of the ideas in the previous segment pertain to the good use of information collected by the government, such information can be used against the people just as easily as it's used for protecting the people. The use of information from social media can easily be misinterpreted by law enforcement and other government entities. For example, when collecting information from social media pictures are commonly used as evidence or as leads in an investigation, while this practice may be useful it can be dangerous when said information is interpreted incorrectly or not fully understood. This can lead to assumptions that could lead to arresting or detaining the wrong person in an attempt to gain information. another issue when information is being gathered from social media is the censoring that people do because they worry of being monitored. While these practices are only done by the person posting, the worry of being monitored causes people to censor not only pictures but also prevent them from expressing themselves fully. This can make people feel as though they have lost their freedom of expression and speech.
</p>
<header><b>Final word</b></header>
    <p>	These points made for both the pros and the cons of government monitoring of social media show that while it may be beneficial it needs to be regulated. The only form of this practice should be watched closely to prevent its misuse and protect the people from overuse of its power. The idea of social media monitoring, while inherently good, can be misused. It is the right of the people to decide whether such methods of monitoring are acceptable because it is their privacy on the line and their lives if this power is used by bad actors.</p>
